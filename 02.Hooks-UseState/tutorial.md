# Hooks :Usestate

### Why do we need `Usestate`:

- To update ,manipulate ,change in ReactJS
- add button and increase the value,but doesn't increase
- the reason for bug - we don't trigger re-render

```js
const ErrorExample = () => {
  let count = 0;
  const handleClick = () => {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{count}</h2>
      <button className="btn" type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
        increase
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ErrorExample;
```

#### useState properties and syntax

- useState hook
- returns an array with two elements: the current state value, and a function that we can use to update the state
- accepts default value as an argument
- state update triggers re-render

```js
import { useState } from "react";
const UseStateBasics = () => {
  //usestate initialization
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  //useState function
  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h4>You clicked {count} times</h4>
      <button type="button" className="btn" onClick={handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UseStateBasics;
```

#### Initial Render and Re-Renders

In a React application, the initial render is the first time that the component tree is rendered to the DOM. It happens when the application first loads, or when the root component is first rendered. This is also known as "mounting" the components.

Re-renders, on the other hand, happen when the component's state or props change, and the component needs to be updated in the DOM to reflect these changes. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize the process of updating the actual DOM, so that only the necessary changes are made.

There are a few ways that you can trigger a re-render in a React component:

- By changing the component's state or props. When the component's state or props change, React will re-render the component to reflect these changes.

- When the parent element re-renders, even if the component's state or props have not changed.

```js
import { useState } from "react";

const UseStateObject = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState("peter");
  const [age, setAge] = useState(24);
  const [hobby, setHobby] = useState("read books");

  const displayPerson = () => {
    setName("john");
    setAge(28);
    setHobby("scream at the computer");
  };
  return (
    <>
      <h3>{name}</h3>
      <h3>{age}</h3>
      <h4>Enjoys To: {hobby}</h4>
      <button className="btn" onClick={displayPerson}>
        show john
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

export default UseStateObject;
```

- We can overwrite in setting the object in useState.

  ```js
  const displayPerson = () => {
    setPerson({ ...person, name: "person" });
  };
  ```

- Keep in mind that the state update function setState does not immediately mutate the state. Instead, it schedules an update to the state and tells React that it needs to re-render the component. The actual state update will be performed as part of the next rendering cycle. Be mindful when you need to set state value based on a different state value.
- If you want to update the state immediately and synchronously, you can pass a function to setState that receives the previous state as an argument and returns the new state. For example:

  ```js
  setState((prevState) => {
    return { ...prevState, value: newValue };
  });
  ```

#### **`useEffect` hooks**

useEffect is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in function components.There is no need for urban dictionary - basically any work outside of the component. Some examples of side effects are: subscriptions, fetching data, directly updating the DOM, event listeners, timers, etc.

- useEffect hook
- accepts two arguments (second optional)
- first argument - cb function
- second argument - dependency array
- by default runs on each render (initial and re-render)
- cb can't return promise (so can't make it async)
- if dependency array empty [] runs only on initial render
